This repository is my library for data analysis tool using Python. Enjoy!


## 1. Spider Chart Automation

<br>
Hello, this is my first automation script using python. If you are wanted to create some spider chart in a huge amount (lot of data) at once with csv, you are in the right place! Grab and go! :D

## 2. Geocoding with Here API

<a href="https://github.com/nooglersoon/Python-Automation/blob/main/geocoding.py"> Geocoding with Here API </a>
<br>
The goals is to make an automation for geocoding with HERE Map API from a csv file that contained the list of address. Many case in my region, that we have no spatial-formatted data about public facilities. Just a list of address instead. So, I decided to built this script to make spatial data analyst easier to directly consume the data without have to convert it manually through internet :D
All the script is written in python 3. Enjoy! ðŸ”¥

## 3. GeoJSON Parsing

<br>
Based on my experience as spatial data analyst, I hard to find a good example of json parsing method with python, especially converted directly to spatial data format like shapefile or GeoJSON. I tried to create my own script and worked very well. Go clone and try it on your Jupyter notebook ðŸ˜‹
